# SoundingCanvas

Interactive paintings that respond to touch with sound.  
SoundingCanvas combines capacitive sensing, AI-driven audio synthesis, and real-time DSP to create immersive audio-visual experiences. It is built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Python, and C++.

## Overview

SoundingCanvas is a fusion of art and technology where each painting is embedded with sensors that detect user touch and activate unique soundscapes or musical samples. The system leverages AI techniques to explore correlations between visual features of the artwork and sound parameters, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for viewers.

Key features include:  
- Capacitive touch sensing integrated directly into the canvas  
- Activation of pre-recorded audio samples or real-time generated sounds  
- Use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for linking visual features to sound characteristics  
- Spatial audio output via multi-speaker setups for immersive sound spatialization  

## Hardware & Software

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi with HiFiBerry audio modules, Arduino microcontrollers, capacitive sensing electrodes  
- **Software:** Python and C++ for signal processing and AI models, custom DSP algorithms for audio synthesis
